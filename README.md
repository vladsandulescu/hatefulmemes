# The Hateful Memes challenge

## Moving of the GDrive files (checkpoints, data)
I have moved the 4 archives containing checkpoints and other intermediate data to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uPukz8AZIcFOgaajGfeJYuQfl9PMYJU9?usp=sharing. As a result, the rest of the Gdrive links below will not work and you can download all of the archives from the above link.

## Post-competition findings
While I was cleaning up the code and documenting my best leaderboard solution I discovered
I had made a mistake when training the model. Specifically the model was being trained 
after the first epoch in eval mode only, i.e. no dropout and batchnorm.
This is obviously a mistake and you shouldn't do it. Turns out that a single UNITER
model might be on par with my best leaderboard solution involving 12 models with paired-attention, 
which seems to have little to no effect. As a consequence I expect now an ensemble of plain UNITER models to outperform
my best leaderboard solution. Imagine my unpleasant surprise finding this after the competition ended.
Oh well, so if you want to do it the right way, make sure to include 
`model.train()` [here](https://github.com/vladsandulescu/hatefulmemes/blob/c966336ddbff0a938a8e1632baa7032c6e84f050/UNITER/train_hm.py#L350),
before returning the test results, similar to the validation part.  

*NOTE*: The rest of the documentation below reflects the state of the solution until the competition ended
and since the organizers need to reproduce my solution, I will not push the post-competition fix just yet.

## Introduction
My best scoring solution to the [Hateful Memes: Phase 2](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/70/hateful-memes-phase-2/) 
challenge comprises of an ensemble of a single UNITER model architecture (average over probabilities) 
[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11740) [[code]](https://github.com/ChenRocks/UNITER), 
which I have adapted for this competition. I have customized the paired-attention 
approach from the UNITER paper to include image captions
inferred from the [Im2txt implemention](https://github.com/HughKu/Im2txt) of the 
[Show and Tell: Lessons learned from the 2015 MSCOCO Image Captioning Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06647) 
paper. Albeit it didn't improve my results by a lot (around 1% for the AUC). However I really liked the simplicity of it. I extracted ROI boxes and 
image features by adapting the 
[Bottom-up Attention with Detectron2](https://github.com/airsplay/py-bottom-up-attention) 
work which in itself is a pytorch adaptation of the original 
[bottom-up-attention](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention) approach using
caffe.

In a nutshell, the paired attention approach was used in the UNITER paper to pair images for the NLVR competition. There the model input was a pair 
[[img1, txt], [img2, txt]], thus repeating the text for each pair. I basically just turned that on its head and did [[img, txt1], [img, txt2]] where the first text was the supplied meme text and the second text was the caption from running inference on the images using the Im2txt code. 

The overall goal was to get familiar with the multimodal SOTA models out there 
and not focus too much on fancier ensembling or stacking. I find it much more fun to try to improve 
a single architecture. I also haven't spent much time tuning the hyperparameters, 
you will notice they are quite similar to the ones the UNITER authors used.

A lot of info up to here, let's take it step by step. If you want to replicate my solution, 
here's what you need to do.

### Prepare

Please read the instructions entirely first, before starting the process, to ensure you have
at last some overview before you start. It is also **very** useful to read the installation instructions
from the original repos I have used to get an even better overview. 
In my experience, running somebody else's scripts on your own instance setup rarely works out of the box the first time.

### Environment
* Ubuntu 16.04, CUDA 9.0, GCC 5.4.0
* Anaconda 3
* Python 3.6.x (pandas and jupyterlab needed)

### Separate multiple conda environments
The project consists of three sub-projects which have been adapted for this task:
1. [Bottom-up Attention with Detectron2](https://github.com/airsplay/py-bottom-up-attention)
2. [Im2txt: image captioning inference](https://github.com/HughKu/Im2txt)
3. [UNITER: UNiversal Image-TExt Representation Learning](https://github.com/ChenRocks/UNITER) 

I **strongly** recommend creating a separate conda environment for each. 
For this there is a script in the *conda* folder in each of the sub-projects. 
They are all independent, so they should each work as a standalone project, requiring only a path to the data folder.
Sure there is a flow, with py-bottom-up-attention and Im2txt working as feature extractors for UNITER down the line.
It is more for convenience I bundled them in one package in order to document the solution. 
Once you cloned the repo, you should see this structure and among other things, there are three scripts:
```bash
    hatefulmemes
    ├── Im2txt
    │   ├── conda
    │   │   ├── init_im2txt_ubuntu.sh
    │   ├── ...
    ├── py-bottom-up-attention
    │   ├── conda
    │   │   ├── init_bua_ubuntu.sh
    │   ├── ...
    └── UNITER
        ├── conda
        │   ├── init_uniter_ubuntu.sh
        └── ...
```
Please pay attention to the `/path/to/` and `anaconda3` paths in the scripts.
You need to change this to the location of your cloned repo and conda respectively.
Afterwards run the scripts to create each of the conda environments. 

### Alternative installation instructions
If you prefer not to, or you cannot make it work using the scripts above, 
you can also follow the installation instructions from the original repos. 
That's where my scripts come from anyway.

### Download required datasets and pretrained models
#### 0. The HM dataset
Grab the [HM dataset for phase 2](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/70/hateful-memes-phase-2/data/) 
and place the unzipped files inside a `data` folder, under the project root for example
(on the same level with `Im2txt`, `py-bottom-up-attention` and `UNITER`).

Grab the [dev_seen_unseen.jsonl](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ASW0JTYxl9Wazu3GVeqAllaWxndUq1iY/view?usp=sharing) file and place it in the same folder as the other `jsonl` files 
provided by the organizers.

*NOTE*:
Since no good data should go to waste, I have merged the dev_seen and dev_unseen sets.
This increased the size of the validation set to 640 samples, instead of 500.
Also the final predictions on the test_unseen set have been produced by training 
the UNITER model on **train+dev_seen_unseen**.

If you don't want to readily download the **dev_seen_unseen.jsonl** file, 
you can also build it yourself by running the `notebooks/ph2_merge_dev_seen_unseen.ipynb` notebook.

#### 1. py-bottom-up-attention
The required pretrained models should be downloaded automatically when running it.

Otherwise please follow the [original instructions](https://github.com/airsplay/py-bottom-up-attention#note) and
download the [10-100 boxes original model weights](http://nlp.cs.unc.edu/models/faster_rcnn_from_caffe_attr_original.pkl).
Or take the shortcut below, but please always check the original link since the author might have made changes in the meantime.
```bash 
wget --no-check-certificate http://nlp.cs.unc.edu/models/faster_rcnn_from_caffe_attr_original.pkl -P ~/.torch/fvcore_cache/models/
```

#### 2. Im2txt
For Im2txt follow the [original instructions](https://github.com/HughKu/Im2txt#get-pre-trained-model), 
or take the shortcut below, but please always check the original link since the author might have made changes in the meantime.

"Download [inceptionv3 finetuned parameters over 1M](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r4-9FEIbOUyBSvA-fFVFgvhFpgee6sF5) 
and you will get 4 files, and make sure to put them all into this path 
`Im2txt/im2txt/model/Hugh/train/`
* newmodel.ckpt-2000000.data-00000-of-00001
* newmodel.ckpt-2000000.index
* newmodel.ckpt-2000000.meta
* checkpoint
"

#### 3. UNITER
For Uniter follow the [original instructions](https://github.com/ChenRocks/UNITER#quick-start), 
more specifically the [pretrained UNITER-large model](https://github.com/ChenRocks/UNITER/blob/master/scripts/download_pretrained.sh), 
or take the shortcut below to download the pretrained model, but please always check the original link since the author might have made changes in the meantime.

*NOTE*: the path to the pretrained model has to match the path in your training config file.

```bash 
wget https://convaisharables.blob.core.windows.net/uniter/pretrained/uniter-large.pt -P /path/to/UNITER/storage/pretrained/
```

### Running the models
#### 1. Extracting bounding boxes and image features

You can download the already extracted bboxes + features files 
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XwLCpawhF4AMzJRG7sqG4uPywnL9YrTF/view?usp=sharing).
Otherwise you can extract them yourself using the following code from `py-bottom-up-attention`. 
The code extracts the features and places the `tsv` file for all the images in the `imgfeat` folder.
This will take about one hour to execute (NVidia V100 GPU). However, note that you will implicitly 
shuffle the training set by doing so and UNITER's sampler will cause training batches to be different 
than my training batches. This means that even if you replicate the environment precisely, there might
still be small differences in results. But since the final step is an average over probabilities, the 
overall differences on the test_unseen set should be negligible.  

```bash
conda activate bua

python demo/detectron2_mscoco_proposal_maxnms_hm.py 
    --split img 
    --data_path /path/to/data/ 
    --output_path /path/to/data/imgfeat/
    --output_type tsv 
    --min_boxes 10 --max_boxes 100 
```
Split up the `tsv` file into each of the sets, by joining with the `jsonl` files. This will 
create another set of `tsv` files, which will be ingested by UNITER.
```bash
python demo/hm.py --split img --split_json_file train.jsonl --d2_file_suffix d2_10-100_vg --data_path /path/to/data/ --output_path /path/to/data/imgfeat/
python demo/hm.py --split img --split_json_file dev_seen_unseen.jsonl --d2_file_suffix d2_10-100_vg --data_path /path/to/data/ --output_path /path/to/data/imgfeat/
python demo/hm.py --split img --split_json_file test_unseen.jsonl --d2_file_suffix d2_10-100_vg --data_path /path/to/data/ --output_path /path/to/data/imgfeat/ 
```

This is how your `data` folder structure should look like now:
```bash
    hatefulmemes
    ├── data
    │   ├── img (all the memes, .png files)
    │   ├── train.jsonl
    │   ├── dev_seen.jsonl
    │   ├── dev_unseen.jsonl
    │   ├── dev_seen_unseen.jsonl
    │   ├── test_unseen.jsonl
    │   ├── imgfeat/d2_10-100_vg/tsv/img.tsv
    │   ├── data_train_d2_10-100_vg.tsv
    │   ├── data_dev_seen_unseen_d2_10-100_vg.tsv
    │   ├── data_test_unseen_d2_10-100_vg.tsv
    │   ├── ...
    ├── Im2txt
    ├── py-bottom-up-attention
    └── UNITER
```

#### 2. Inferring image captions
Download the already inferred captions file 
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VhXKeMS1CNfhUOrVe93QxYMa6BGzZdTX/view?usp=sharing) and place it under `data/im2txt` folder.
Otherwise, run the following code yourself.

This will take about one hour on a multicore CPU only machine. 

```bash
conda activate im2txt

python im2txt/run_inference.py 
    --checkpoint_path="im2txt/model/Hugh/train/newmodel.ckpt-2000000" 
    --vocab_file="im2txt/data/Hugh/word_counts.txt" 
    --input_files="/path/to/data/img/*.png"
```
Take the output csv file `df_ph2.csv` and remember to place it under `data/im2txt` folder.

This is how your `data` folder structure should look like now:
```bash
    hatefulmemes
    ├── data
    │   ├── im2txt/df_ph2.csv
    │   ├── ...
    │   ├── img (all the memes, .png files)
    │   ├── train.jsonl
    │   ├── dev_seen.jsonl
    │   ├── dev_unseen.jsonl
    │   ├── dev_seen_unseen.jsonl
    │   ├── test_unseen.jsonl
    │   ├── imgfeat/d2_10-100_vg/tsv/img.tsv
    │   ├── data_train_d2_10-100_vg.tsv
    │   ├── data_dev_seen_unseen_d2_10-100_vg.tsv
    │   ├── data_test_unseen_d2_10-100_vg.tsv
    │   ├── ...
    ├── Im2txt
    ├── py-bottom-up-attention
    └── UNITER
```

#### 3. Training UNITER with paired attention
Training just one UNITER model on both `train+dev_seen_unseen` takes about one hour on 
a Nvidia V100 GPU with 32GB RAM. If you only have 16GB RAM on your GPU, 
you have to modify `train_batch_size` and `gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep the 
effective batch size the same. 
E.g. If you reduce the train_batch_size by half to 3328, the gradient_accumulation_steps needs to be doubled to 2.
Also the current implementation does not support distributed training.

*NOTE*: If you modify the config file however, you will of course get slightly different results, 
but the overall difference should be negligible when averaging over probabilities output from multiple UNITER models.  

To replicate my leaderboard solution, you need to train 12 UNITER models with different seeds. Why 12? Well, because the number has a certain something to it, there were 12 monkeys, or 12 full lunations of the moon in a year, or the number of years for a full cycle of Jupiter, and the reasons can go on and on I guess.
The final probabilities should be the average over the probabilities from the 12 model ensemble.
The only difference between these UNITER models is simply the seed. Training is done as mentioned
before on both `train+dev_seen_unseen` and every `valid_steps` inference is performed on `test_unseen`, 
writing the results to a csv file.
```bash
conda activate uniter

python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_0.json
python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_24.json
python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_42.json
python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_77.json
python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_2018.json
python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_12345.json
python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_32768.json
python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_54321.json
python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_10101010.json
python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_20200905.json
python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_55555555.json
python train_hm.py --config config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_2147483647.json
```

*NOTE*: You should only care about the files `test_results_1140_rank0_final.csv`, the rest are just intermediate results.
Use the `notebooks/ph2_leaderboard.ipynb` to generate the final leaderboard results, but make sure to change the UNITER 
output paths first.

#### 4. Running inference to get predictions
You can download the [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18xuRFdlDNrUyXKA1AzENai7Z0h_rM3aF/view?usp=sharing) for all of the 12 models and then just run inference to get the predictions without training the models.
In order to run inference on the test set, you need to have two json files in place next to a checkpoint.
`/path/to/train_dir/log/model.json` and `/path/to/train_dir/log/hps.json`. These should match
the default pretrained UNITER-large `config/uniter-large.json` file and
your UNITER training file respectively,
e.g. `config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_0.json` for the model using seed 0.
You can simply copy and rename the two files to `model.json` and `hps.json`, but do keep in mind the different seed from each checkpoint. 

*NOTE*: If you don't download the checkpoints and prefer to train the model yourself, you don't
need to copy these files, since the training part will already copy them in the correct folder.

The structure of the checkpoint and log folders should look like this:
```bash
    ├── seed_0
    │   ├── ckpt
    │   │   ├── model_step_1140.pt
    │   ├── log
    │   │   ├── model.json (*NOTE* content matches config/uniter-large.json)
    │   │   ├── hps.json (*NOTE* content matches config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_0.json)
    │   ├── ...
    ├── seed_24
    │   ├── ckpt
    │   │   ├── model_step_1140.pt
    │   ├── log
    │   │   ├── model.json (*NOTE* content matches config/uniter-large.json)
    │   │   ├── hps.json (*NOTE* content matches config/ph2_uniter_seeds/train-hm-large-pa-1gpu-hpc_24.json)
    ├── ...
```
Run inference on the `test_unseen` set.
```bash
python inf_hm.py --root_path ./ --dataset_path /path/to/data \
    --test_image_set test --train_dir /path/to/train_dir \
    --ckpt 1140 --output_dir /path/to/output \
    --fp16
```
